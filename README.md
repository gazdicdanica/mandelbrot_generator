# Mandelbrot Generator
- 10

## Definition
The Mandelbrot set is a two-dimensional set with a definition that exhibits great complexity, especially when magnified. It has its origin in complex dynamics

The set is defined in the complex plane as the complex numbers $c$ for which the function $f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$ does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at $z=0$, i.e., for which the sequence $f_{c}(0)$, $f_{c}(f_{c}(0))$, etc., remains bounded in absolute value.

## Solution
The solution will be implemented in Python and Rust, sequential and parallelised, as well as visualization of the final result
